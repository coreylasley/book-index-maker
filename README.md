# Book Index Maker
Quickly generate a back of the book index for your book from a PDF

I originally wrote this software back in 2012 when I was looking for some software that I could use to help me build a back of the book index for a 500+ page book I had written and was planning on self publishing. When I was not able to locate anything affordable, I decided to take on the task of writing such software myself. I had initially planned on marketing the software to other self publishing authors, but have decided to simply make it available for free, especially since it isnâ€™t a completely polished application, and written specifically for Windows.

I would like to eventually port this application to a Progressive Web App.
